# Contributing to Library Management System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/gaddamnithinreddy/librarymanagementsystem/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/gaddamnithinreddy/librarymanagementsystem/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/librarymanagementsystem.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm run install-all`
4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
5. Start development servers: `npm run dev-full`

## Code Style

- Use ESLint for JavaScript linting
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Feature Requests

We track feature requests as GitHub issues. When creating a feature request, please:

1. Use a clear and descriptive title
2. Provide a detailed description of the suggested feature
3. Explain why this feature would be useful
4. List any alternative solutions you've considered

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to ask questions by creating an issue or reaching out to the maintainers.
